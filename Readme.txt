Thank you for your submission to Computers & Geosciences.
 
I think your paper is a good fit for the journal, but I cannot accept it for review in its present form.
 
You may be familiar with the reproducibility crisis in machine learning. This stems from inadequate documentation of machine learning models and their usage.
 
With this in mind, there are a number of deficiencies with the associated Github repo which should be fixed.
*There should be a README file which explains what the various scripts do, how to use the software, how to prepare data, etc.
*The user needs to know what versions of the supporting libraries are needed (preferably via a conda environment file).
*The files themselves seem to contain hard coded paths (e.g. here); these should be variables.
*A test data set used to demonstrate the operation of the software should also be present
*An open source license file is needed.
 
Please fix these issues and we can proceed to review.
